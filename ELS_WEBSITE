        <h2>About Shih Tzus</h2>
        <p>
            Shih Tzus are a wonderful and charming dog breed known for their friendly and affectionate nature. They are small in size, with a distinctive long, flowing coat that requires regular grooming. Shih Tzus are great companions and make lovely pets for families and individuals alike.

            I have always been fascinated by Shih Tzus due to their adorable appearance and sweet temperament. Their loyalty and playful nature make them a perfect addition to any home. On this page, I want to share my love for Shih Tzus and provide information about their care, training, and more.
